  <p class="mb-6 text-xl md:text-2xl uppercase">Sampling is the act of taking a piece, or sample, of a sound recording and using it as an instrument in a different song or piece. Sampling was originally developed for electroacoustic music, but by the late 1960s, the use of sampling influenced the production of psychedelic rock and jazz music. However, Hip-Hop was the first popular music genre based on the art of sampling. In the 1970s DJ’s experimented with manipulating vinyls on a pair of turntables with an audio mixer. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Samples often consist of one part of another song. It is popular to take drum breaks (parts of a song that soley consist of rhythmic elements) and use that as the beat for your own production. It is also possible to change up the rhythm using manipulation to create a pattern of your own, but still using another sound. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Sampling does not always consist of using other person’s records. A large number of producers and musicians have created songs by sampling recordings that they made themselves. For example, one popular hip hop artists who constantly samples his own work is Ice Cube.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Sampling is controversial legally and musically. Back in the 70’s, artists sometimes did not receive permission from the sampled artist to use their recordings. Copyright owners would jump right on this to receive their royalties. When hip hop began, most of the DJ’s at block parties did not need to “clear the sample”. However, once the genre became more mainstream, and artists began recording music, it became necessary for artists to obtain permission to use samples in their productions. This was a difficult thing to do, and thus a number of artists ran into legal issues. </p>

	    <p class="mb-4 md:text-xl">Aside from legal issues, sampling has also been criticized musically. Some critics believe that sampling removes creativity from the song making process, while others say that sampling is a revolutionary process. The debate continues today, with both sides having valid reasons for what they believe. </p>

<div class="font-serif leading-normal mx-auto py-12 px-4 max-w-lg">
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Today, while most music is created digitally, sampling from vinyl’s is widely considered a pretty common method of sampling. It’s possible to purchase a record player and connect it to your laptop for use in a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). For anyone who is even remotely considering getting into music production, I highly recommend this method of sampling. It is more cost efficient, interactive, and the large library of vinyl records from a store means that you will always be able to find new works to potentially use in your music. </p>
