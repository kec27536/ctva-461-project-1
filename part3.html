  <p class="mb-6 text-xl md:text-2xl uppercase">Reason #3 why you should invest in vinyl records is that it is a fun hobby to build up a collection. It’s easy to get lost in the organic progress of digging through crates of old records and coming across weird and obscure records. A lot of these records may have never been ported to CD let alone modern digital formats. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">If you’re like me, you like to feel like you’re getting your money’s worth. For example, I’m the type of person who still likes to purchase video games physically so that I can look at the box art and smell that brand new video game smell. Same thing goes for vinyls. When you purchase a new disc for your collection, you get to appreciate the work that goes into making the music more. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg mb-4 bold border-blue-light border-l-8 border-r-8 px-12 mt-16  md:text-3xl font-bold"> Now the question is... how does one begin to collect vinyl records? </p>

  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">If you’re new to collecting vinyl, or if you are recently coming back to collecting them, then you should know there is a right and a wrong way of doing so. You want to make sure you do it the right way to keep this hobby relatively inexpensive. The process itself isn’t so complicated, and when done right, it’s easy. Here’s a short guide to get you started:</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Step #1: Go out and purchase some records. Sounds simple enough right? You just need to make sure that when you’re purchasing the records to check the disc to make sure they’re still in working condition. This means no scratches in the grooves! Some records stores will even let you test the disc on a turntable with a pair of headphones. If the disc isn’t in the best condition, ask the manager if you can swap it out for a better one. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
Step #2: Clean your records. After completing your haul, before you pop those bad boys open and throw them on the turntable, make sure you give it a good cleaning! There are several ways to do this. The most cost effective way to do so, is to buy a carbon fiber brush. These run about $15 and should suffice for records that are a bit dusty. There are also record cleaning machines for your more serious cases. Finally, if these are too steep for your pockets, many record stores will clean your disc for free! 
</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Step #3: Clean your needle. Cleaning your needle is essential, because it can build up grime and can alter the sound of your records. There are many ways to go about cleaning your needle. The cheapest option is to buy a small needle brush. These run for about $15; however, many high end turntables will come with one. Make sure you brush it from back-to-front. Any other way will damage the needle! Another way to clean your needle is by getting a needle bed. A little bit easier, you simply drop the needle into the bed and the contents will clean the needle. A little bit less of a hassle, also a bit more costly at about 40$. At this point, you're all set! Pop that bad boy in the record player and give it a go! I personally would recommend headphones so you can get that intamte experience.  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Step #4: After you’re done listening to your vinyls, it’s important to properly store them! It’s important to store them in a way that they won’t get damaged, but also in a way that looks completely kick ass! One popular method is to use milk crates. Milk crates are free, and oddly enough they’re the perfect size to hold your records. However, this method often leads to sleeves getting torn, and records getting scratched, so I’d avoid that one. Shelves are a pretty common way to store your records. If you need to take your records on the go, there are plenty of compact wooden crates that are specifically made for carrying vinly.</p>
