  <p class="mb-6 text-xl md:text-2xl uppercase">The second reason why you should start investing in vinyl records is for the experience. Now, when I say experience, I mean the whole idea of going to a record store, and picking out a piece with an interesting cover, and then taking it home and listening to it.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">The problem is that in today’s world, music is so accessible to everyone. Everyone has a smart phone, and with smart phones you can easily download music streaming applications such as Tidal, Apple Music, or Spotify. Now if you want to hear new music, one can simply look it up on their phone. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">However, back in the days when vinyl was the prime way to gain access to music, people had to physically go to record stores to buy new music. This led to an experience that not everyone today has experienced. In a similar way that movie lovers loved going into a blockbuster and exploring films to bring home on a Friday night, music lovers could walk into a record store not knowing what they wanted to purchase. They would simply look for album covers that looked interesting, and then buy it. The excitement would build up while on your way home, and then finally, you get to listen to your brand new analog record. This can lead to you exploring and discovering new artists and adding to your repetoire. </p>

<div class="font-serif leading-normal mx-auto py-12 px-4 max-w-lg">
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Part of the vinyl experience is having the needle create a crackle effect that’s also known as surface noise. Vinyl lovers love the sound of this; its artistic, beautiful, and adds to the overall experience. In addition, the fact that vinyl records are analog and have grooves, means that they will ultimately sound better than any music recorded digitally.  </p>
